##To do:

- [ ] HMR is not working on HTML pages ( does not refresh on save )
- [x] Html files are added manually to Webpack Config, is there a way to import dynamically from the page folder?
- [ ] Since index.js is added to each html file it will show 'property of null' when elements or id's are not found on that specific page.
